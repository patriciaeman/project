    <h1>Policies</h1>
    <p> Here at Bright Futures Program prioritizes the safety and supervision of all participants. Children must be signed in and out by an authorized adult, ensuring accountability. Staff-to-child ratios meet or exceed state requirements to guarantee proper supervision, and emergency drills for scenarios such as fires, earthquakes, or lockdowns are conducted monthly to maintain preparedness.</p>
 <br></br>
    <p>Participants are expected to adhere to a strict code of conduct, treating peers, staff, and property with respect. Bullying, harassment, or discrimination is not tolerated under any circumstances and will result in disciplinary action. Any behavior that is disruptive or unsafe may lead to suspension or dismissal from the program.</p>
   
    <br></br>
    <p>To promote health and wellness, parents must inform the program of any medical conditions, allergies, or dietary restrictions their child may have. Children who are sick with contagious illnesses or a fever must stay home to protect others. Snacks and meals provided by the program meet established nutritional standards. </p>
    <br></br>
<p>Parents and guardians play an essential role in our program. They are expected to provide up-to-date emergency contact information and are encouraged to participate in family nights and parent workshops. Open communication with staff regarding concerns or feedback is highly valued and helps us improve the program.
</p>
    <br></br>

    <p>Technology use is limited to educational or program-related activities. Personal devices, such as phones and tablets, may only be used with staff permission during designated times, and social media use is strictly prohibited during program hours. Our program devices are reserved for learning and program-specific tasks.</p>
    <br></br>

    <p>    Our program is committed to inclusion and non-discrimination. We welcome children of all backgrounds, abilities, and identities. To ensure equitable participation, accommodations are made for children with special needs. Activities are designed to celebrate and respect cultural diversity and individual perspectives.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    
    <p>    Emergency preparedness is an integral part of our operations. CPR-trained staff and first-aid kits are present during all activities. In the event of an emergency involving a child, parents are notified immediately, and incidents are documented to ensure program safety and improve future responses.
    </p>
    <br></br>
 
    <p>Program fees, if applicable, must be paid by their due date. To support families in need, scholarships and sliding-scale payment options are available. Refunds are issued only under specific circumstances outlined in our policies to maintain fairness.</p>
    <br></br>

    <p>Volunteers and staff undergo background checks and complete mandatory training to ensure they are equipped to serve our community. Staff are role models, exemplifying positive behavior and upholding program values, while volunteers follow program guidelines under staff supervision to provide a safe and enriching environment.</p>
