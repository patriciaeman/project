         <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The Bright Futures Program was founded in 2010 with a mission to provide equitable access to education and enrichment opportunities for children in underserved communities. The program began as a small initiative, offering tutoring and extracurricular activities in a local community center. Over time, it grew into a comprehensive support system addressing academic, social, and emotional needs, serving hundreds of students annually.

We are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment where every child can grow academically, socially, and emotionally.

                The program aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) by working to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all. By providing access to qualified tutors, technology, and engaging learning materials, it closes educational gaps and helps children build the skills they need to thrive. In areas where resources are scarce, the program also partners with local schools to enhance their offerings and extend learning opportunities beyond the classroom.
